# Tree Space

Display the topologies of 3-taxa tree sampled from MCMC 
under Kingman's coalescent model.

## 3 Taxa

There are 3 different topologies in this tree space:
1. `T=0`, where the tree is `(A,B),C`; 
2. `T=1`, where the tree is `(A,C),B`; 
3. `T=2`, where the tree is `(B,C),A`. 

We define the tree interval _k<sub>1</sub>_ is the root height minus
internal node height, and _k<sub>2</sub>_ is the internal node height.
Both _k<sub>1</sub>_ and _k<sub>2</sub>_ are simulated by Kingman's coalescent 
model using MCMC, where the probability of genealogies in a population is:

P(k<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>, T | Ne) = 
(1/Ne) * e<sup>(-k<sub>1</sub>/Ne)</sup> * (1/Ne) * e<sup>(-3*k<sub>2</sub>/Ne)</sup> 

Assuming Ne = 1, then the above equation is simplified to:

P(k<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>, T) = e<sup>-k<sub>1</sub></sup> * e<sup>(-3*k<sub>2</sub>)</sup>

The proposal during MCMC sampling makes the equal probability change _k<sub>1</sub>_ and _k<sub>2</sub>_ using the random walk algorithm, where the jump size _w_ is default to 1.
When _k<sub>1</sub>_ is smaller than 0, there will be an equal probability 
to change the tree from this topology to any of another two topologies.

The animation of 500 samples is available from
